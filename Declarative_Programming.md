# What is Declarative Programming?
In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure 
and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

## Declarative Programming Vs. Imperative Programming

**Declarative programming** is a programming paradigm … that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

**Imperative programming** is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program’s state.

## In a human language: 
**Declarative Programming** is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don’t care how they draw it, that’s up to them.
**Imperative Programming** is like your friend listening to Bob Ross tell them how to paint a landscape. While good ole Bob Ross isn’t exactly commanding, he is giving them step by step directions to get the desired result.
